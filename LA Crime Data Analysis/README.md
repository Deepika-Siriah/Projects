** LA Crime Data Analysis **

The goal of the project is to determine the trends in crime, geographic location that has higher number of crimes, and time of the day where the maximum crime takes place. This would help the Police Dept. to implement preventive measures that would aid to minimize the crimes and increase awareness in LA residents.
