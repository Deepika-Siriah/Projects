**Accident Rate Prediction**

The project had the following goals:
1. The objective of the project is to create a model that can accurately predict accident severity Fatal or Slight/Serious.
2. Identify important predictors of road accidents
3. Determine the best predictive models

The value of figuring out these goals is two folds: 
1. The information can be used by governments, city planners, engineers in designing safer roads.
2. The information can be used by insurance to measure risk and assign liability.
